# App Store Analysis Project

This project compares data from Apple and Google app stores to understand trends, including app popularity and potential profitability. 
The project explores and analyzes which categories and types of apps attract the most downloads and user interest. 
By identifying these patterns, we aim to deduce which types of apps may lead to higher profitability, especially for free apps with monetization options.

## The project consists of two main Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. Exploring and Transforming the Data

Loading datasets from Apple and Google Play stores.
Conducting initial data cleaning and transformations.
Preparing the data for further analysis by handling missing values, formatting columns, and ensuring consistency across datasets.

### 2. Analysis

This notebook builds on the transformed data to generate frequency tables and descriptive statistics for app categories, pricing models, and user ratings.
Visualize trends in app popularity across categories and determine which types of free apps tend to gain higher user engagement.
Explore potential correlations between app characteristics (like category or user rating) and overall profitability indicators (like estimated downloads or ratings).

## Datasets
The project uses two main datasets:

`Apple Store Data:` Contains information on app name, category, price, rating, and other relevant attributes.
`Google Play Store Data:` Includes similar app information for Google Play apps.

## Objectives

The main questions this project aims to answer are:

Which types of apps are most popular across Apple and Google Play stores?
What app categories have the potential for profitability, particularly for free apps?
Through these analyses, we hope to identify app characteristics that can guide app developers in creating more profitable and engaging applications.
This analysis will help highlight trends in app stores, providing insights on which categories and features are valuable for app success and monetization potential. 
By focusing on popular free apps, we aim to understand how developers can maximize profitability in competitive app markets.

To run the notebooks:

Ensure that you have `Python` installed with `pandas`.
Open each notebook in a Jupyter environment and follow the instructions for each step.
